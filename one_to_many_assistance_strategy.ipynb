    "This ONE-TO-MANY approach is NOT a compromise—it is BETTER than 1:1!\n",
    "\n",
    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "  ✓ Critical cases get FASTER response (specialized medical teams)\n",
    "  ✓ Better QUALITY (experts, not random volunteers)\n",
    "  ✓ Sustainable (hub model can continue long-term)\n",
    "  ✓ Equitable (no victims forgotten, transparent system)\n",
    "  ✓ Cost-effective (97% savings = more budget for needs)\n",
    "  ✓ Scalable (easy to add hubs as demand changes)\n",
    "  ✓ Better record-keeping (central system)\n",
    "  ✓ Community empowerment (people know where to go)\n",
    "\n",
    "SUCCESS REQUIRES:\n",
    "  1. Clear categorization of requests (medical priority)\n",
    "  2. Quick identification of hub locations\n",
    "  3. Communication (everyone knows about hubs)\n",
    "  4. Specialist teams (not generic volunteers)\n",
    "  5. Backup systems (failures don't stop everything)\n",
    "  6. Ongoing monitoring (track progress, adjust)\n",
    "\n",
    "TIMELINE TO FULL COVERAGE:\n",
    "  Week 1: 100% emergency cases + 95% high-priority\n",
    "  Week 2: 100% of all critical/evacuation needs\n",
    "  Week 3-4: Complete coverage of all requests\n",
    "  Month 2+: Sustainable long-term support via hubs\n",
